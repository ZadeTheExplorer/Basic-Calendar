# Basic-Calendar
This is my first Android application build with Java and android API 26. Demo on Pixel 2 API 26.

As the very first version. This app can only store the event or note for each days.
By using this function, enter your event to Event Name, then select a date. Finaly, click Save.
After that you can retrieve the event by click back to the date. If there is nothing on Event Name, it means no event ever stored on that date.

The will be more feature develop in the near future to enrich the functionalities.
